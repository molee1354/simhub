Problem:

    vis:
        can't live update with the current ./vis method
        current method:
            make 'dump.out' --> and then visualize this with python
            we can use this but we can't use live update / infinite simulation

    files we need:
        sim.input: inital parameters / macros (take input from ui)
            - box size (width, height)
            - simulation time (finite for now)
        board.c/h: class Board(params){ currState: , size: , }
            - some_method( Board* objectname, args ) {}
            - generateNext( *above* ){ #call countNeighbors }
            - countNeighbors()
            - 
        main.c: 
            - Run generateNext(), store board + step #
            - Write all board states in dump.out

  user intervention:
      * Random vs. User generated board button
      * Speed knob: delay between generateNext()
      * Zoom functions (task for later)
        - Zoom knob: zoom in and out from entire board
        - Click-and-drag: navigate the board (assuming zoomed in)
